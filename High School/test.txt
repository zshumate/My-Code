The ideals of comedy and tragedy along with dramatic literature were created by the ancient Greeks. A comedy is a story in which the characters experience conflict and grow through their experiences; comedies have happy endings. On the other hand, tragedies are stories in which a character, normally of high standing, is faced with conflict and is destroyed by his or her fate or actions. These two concepts are at the core of dramatic literature and are pervasive throughout modern media. Tim Burton’s work has been influenced by these concepts; he believes that comedy and tragedy are closely connected in their use in dramatic literature. Much like light and darkness, comedy and tragedy are opposites yet closely tied together.
Tim Burton says most good drama incorporates comedy and tragedy. This is true, and it can be found in all forms of media. This use of both comedy and tragedy is found in Antigone. As the drama approaches denouement, King Creon sees the fault of his actions and attempts to mend the situation, but even though Creon gained wisdom to see his misguided actions, he was too late to save Antigone, his son Haemon, or Queen Eurydice. This coupling of comedy and tragedy is also found in the novel Alas, Babylon by Pat Frank; though Randy Bragg and his community survive, the world is left in the aftermath of nuclear war. Movies are another form of media that use comedy and tragedy together. The Lord of the Rings trilogy uses comedy and tragedy together in its conclusion; Frodo Baggins completes his quest bringing peace to the land, but Gollum meets his tragic end. Modern media relies on the ideals of comedy and tragedy to tell a story that will touch the hearts and minds of the viewers.
Comedy and tragedy are closely tied together. Tim Burton was correct in saying that they are closely connected, for they are often seen together in media. A situation that is tragic for one person can be comedic for another. Used in conjunction, comedy and tragedy continue to hold influence over modern media.
